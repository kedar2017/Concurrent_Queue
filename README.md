# Concurrent_Queue

More things to do:

- Catch more errors and report them in a better way 
- Organize the benchmark and test cases better 
- Currently need to provide the blocksize for GenSPSCQueue,, either eliminate that or handle user errors better
- Work on making the GenSPSCQueue faster - currently performance is comparable with lock-free boost queue
